# Dear Toontown community....
Dear Toontown Online Community: You used to be a great, florishing comunity with tons on potential, but now you have become a toxic wasteland. That is why I am saying goodbye.

I first realised most people in the Toontown Online community were toxic by trying to become a Toontown Offline developer. To make a long story short: they tempted a fellow staff member of their team (who has also left the TTO community) to basically trick me by giving me a fake interview and then joking about something very mean I did long before then.

So, later in life, I started messing with the Toontown Schoolhouse project to see if I could even learn how to become a developer for a Toontown Online Private server. I was suprisingly somewhat successful after some trial and error, because I got a model of a cog tunnel model from Sellbot HQ to load in, and got some non-funcitoning stuff working. Just like I did with my earlier fortays in Toontown Online Private Servers that nobody even liked, but we don't talk about those.

However, I was too scared to share it because I did not want to get roasted by the Toontown community for my crappy combination of my old code, which was based off of Toontown Stride, and this new (mostly Toontown Schoolhouse) code, among other things. 

The final straw was when I heard that Open Toontown, a project lead by some TTOff staff, had basically the same end goal for their project as did Toontown Schoolhouse, and Toontown Stride before it: to get their code into as many people's hands as possible to help the community learn and florish on a base that was (somewhat) reliable and easy to build on top of. After making fun of be for being a skid because I wanted the community to learn from my experiences with Toontown Stride-based code, and published it because of that. And no, I never claimed it was my own. I gave Toontown Stride team credit.

Now don't get me wrong, there are a few good people, or supposedly good people in the Toontown Community (I am looking at you, LoopyGoopyG, you give the best stories and are a genuinely funny guy, at least from a YouTube viewer's view.) But for every 3 good apples, there are 6-8 bad apples. As the toxic people push their toxicity onto the world, however, I am guessing that the nice people of the Toontown Online community will leave, little by little. And the toxic people will suddenly realise that the people they used to make fun of are all gone to bigger, and better things, just like I will now.

With best wishes of the toxicity getting better, but it probably won't:
